How to get this to run:

~~ Installing ~~
pip install these libraries please (I have no idea how to pip install, I did this on IPython Notebooks)

Libraries used:
from glob import glob
from os import getcwd
from os.path import join
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn import preprocessing
import numpy as np
import math as math
from scipy import misc
from scipy import ndimage
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sys

~~ Running ~~
The code has support for command-line arguments but I can't test them because I can't get it to run on GL without the packages. 
Ideally, it would be run as:

python Project3.py FILE_DIRECTORY

where FILE_DIRECTORY is an acceptable file directory. If this doesn't work, and I really hope it does, there is also support for the file directory to be hardcoded in.

~~ Additional Notes ~~
Additional features include retraining the SVM and commented out functions like k-fold validation and displaying the image can be found in main()

"python Project3.py TEACH_SVM"

This should reteach the SVM from the TRAINING folder
