~~ Installing ~~
Installation from scratch:

To get pip:
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential 

Consult for additional dependencies before installing Pillow.
http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/installation.html

For me I had to do: sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev liblcms2-dev libwebp-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev python-tk

pip install Pillow
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
pip install sklearn
pip install scipy

python Project3.py TEACH_SVM

Run TEACH_SVM just once, it doesn't seem to like to use imported pkl files, so just rewrite over them. Make sure TRAINING folder is in the working directory!

Now, feel free to run anyway you like:
python Project3.py file_path
~~ Running ~~
The code has support for command-line arguments but I can't test them because I can't get it to run on GL without the packages. 
Ideally, it would be run as:

python Project3.py FILE_DIRECTORY

where FILE_DIRECTORY is an acceptable file directory. If this doesn't work, and I really hope it does, there is also support for the file directory to be hardcoded in.

~~ Additional Notes ~~
Additional features include retraining the SVM and commented out functions like k-fold validation and displaying the image can be found in main()

"python Project3.py TEACH_SVM"

This should reteach the SVM from the TRAINING folder
